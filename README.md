# Reinforcement Learning Tic Tac Toe Agent
An agent built to play Tic Tac Toe, and learn strategies through reinforcement learning. This was an exercise in an online course that I cannot remember the reference for, and mostly just a way of demonstrating simple reinforcement learning. 

I added some further modifications beyond the scope of the course, including reducing the state space due to the rotational symmetry of the board.
